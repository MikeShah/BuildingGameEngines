# Introduction

We are going to be using gtkD for this course. This is a wrapper around the 'gtk' library that is usd to create user interfaces across multiple platforms.

Most of the documentation for gtk that you find on the web will be similar to the D code that you need to write, but provided will be samples in D.

# Setup

1. First type: `dub init` in a new directory.
	- You can accept the defaults for the project settings as you are learning gtkD.
	- Start off by including a dependency for `gtk-d`.
	- You can find more documentation at [https://code.dlang.org/packages/gtk-d](https://code.dlang.org/packages/gtk-d) regarding setting up gtk-d.
	- For this tutorial, I have tested with gtk-d 3.10.0

## Basic Windowed Application

```dlang

```

## Running the Application

Type `dub run` to run the application.

You should see dub fetch any dependencies (i.e. gtk-d) on your first run.
